In humble villages an artisan is most likely to make the bulk of their living by the same subsistence farming as their neighbors, but in towns and cities they might be full-time professionals, perhaps belonging to some guild or brotherhood specific to their craft. While an artisan’s Craft skill is chiefly applicable to those works related to their background, they often know enough or can improvise sufficiently to make competent efforts at other types of work.",

Still, the material privation of your life does not mean you are necessarily stupid or unadaptable, nor that you lack your own forms of culture.",
