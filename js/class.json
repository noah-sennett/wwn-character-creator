Thieves, diplomats, healers, scholars, explorers, artisans, and other such heroes should pick the Expert class if they wish to focus on developing their special skills and performing tremendous feats of mastery with them. Experts gain the widest variety of non-combat skills and are the quickest to learn more of them.<br><br>    An Expert has an uncanny knack for wielding their skills successfully at a crucial moment, whether or not it’s a skill they’ve taken for their specialty. Once per scene, the Expert can reroll a failed non-combat skill check, gaining a second chance to yank victory from the jaws of otherwise certain failure. Their natural focus on personal development and determined refinement of their skills bleeds through even into those talents they don’t make their special domain.<br><br>    Experts are also capable combatants, fully able to hold their own in the midst of a murderous fray. It’s not unknown for some Experts to specialize in professions related to martial pursuits, such as an assassin who relies heavily on their superb powers of stealth and deception to reach their unwary foes.",
